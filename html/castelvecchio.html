	<div class="projectpagedescription">While I was studying in Italy we took a trip to the abandoned medieval town, Castelvecchio Calviso. The town was struck by an earthquake which forced it's residents to evacuate. We were tasked with creating installations in the old city to bring the residents from the periphery back into the ancient city center. I worked with a few other classmates to clear one of the old civic spaces of rubble and create a place to facilitate gathering. We collected abandoned objects from the town and set up a place for celebration. We invited the residents for an apertivo and an improv performance.</div>
