My name is Phoebe Morrison and I am a junior at The Rhode Island School of Design. I am majoring in Graphic Design and concentrating in The History of Art and Visual Culture. I am very interested in pursuing a graphic design internship for this coming summer.
 
I grew up outside of New York City in a family of artists and designers. Art has always been a big part of my life. I am really comfortable engaging in critique and working in collaboration with others. I am the graphic designer for Brown University's Entrepreneurship Program. It has been great working with students from different backgrounds to help connect people to tools they need to succeed as an entrepreneur. I also attend hackathons regularly. It is fantastic getting to go from ideation to execution in a weekend. I really enjoy the ideation process and solving problems with a user in mind.</div>
