	<div class="projectpagedescription">This is a monument I designed to reflect the work of Mario Botta. I began by researching his work and identifying key motifs in his work. I wanted to design something that would be geometric and monolithic but still incorporate light and shadow. During the sketch model phase I experimented with shadow and how that could activate the form. Botta was inspired by Romanesque architecture which is very austere from the exterior. My final model uses the rising and setting of the sun to cast his name in shadow on the opposing wall. The symmetrical steps on the other side use one of his motifs as a way to display information and Botta’s architectural sketches. The model becomes a response to the environment which is an important element of Botta’s work.</div>
