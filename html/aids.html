	<div class="projectpagetitle">AIDS Exhibit</div>
	<div class="projectpagedescription">I worked on a team with two other students to design an exhibit about a historical event. We selected the AIDS Crisis as our topic. After doing research we began to determine the visuals. One of the required elements was a map so I proposed that the floor be covered in a gradient of red tally marks to symbolize the lives lost. The exhibit includes videos that act as a time line, a wall of newspapers, and a room where visitors can hear the stories of victims.</div>

Newspapers </br>stacked on the floor would have articles </br>repreinted from the first reports on the front </br>page. On the inside the newspaper would </br>contain information about the exhibit. </br>The visitor would take the newspaper with </br>them as them to get more information about</br> what they were seeing. The oposing side of</br> the newspaper is a poster that the could be</br> pasted around the city to raise </br>awarness for the ongoing battle against aids.</p>
