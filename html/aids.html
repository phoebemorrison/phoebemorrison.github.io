	<div class="projectpagedescription">I worked on a team with two other students to design an exhibit about a historical event. We selected the AIDS Crisis as our topic. After doing research we began to determine the visuals. One of the required elements was a map so I proposed that the floor be covered in a gradient of red tally marks to symbolize the lives lost. The exhibit includes videos that act as a time line, a wall of newspapers, and a room where visitors can hear the stories of victims.</div>
