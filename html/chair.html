	<div class="projectpagetitle">Easy Out Chair</div>
	<div class="projectpagedescription">This spring I participated in Brown University's Assistive Tech Make-a-thon. The weekend was focused on developing tools that could help the handicapped. My team and I developed a prototype of a chair that could aid the elderly in transitioning from sitting to standing. The chair has armrests that hinge up and act as bars to push against. We placed a hinge behind the knee so the seat could lift up from the back when the user pushes against the bars. Having a pivot point at the knee keeps the user from having to exert a lot of strength in their lower body.</div>
