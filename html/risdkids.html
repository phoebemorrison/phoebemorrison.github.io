	<div class="projectpagedescription">While working at the RISD Museum, I saw a lot of children visiting the museum. Despite being kid friendly, the museum does not yet have a way to engage young visitors with the art. I designed an app that would be a fun way for kids to learn about art through site specific games. The app also has a lot of games that lead to art creation. With the points gained from playing the games the visitor can get postcards of their art printed at the museum.</div>
