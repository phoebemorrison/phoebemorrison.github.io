	<div class="projectpagedescription">When I first arrived in Rome I was struck my the colors of the buildings. The entire city was washed with warm tones. I began remaking the map of my area in Rome with each building colored the color of the building itself. Using Google Maps Streetview, I gathered data for many different cities and began comparing the different colors of the cities through animation. The animations show individual buildings as you move down the street in cities around the world. I was interested in how the orientation, color, and shape of the buildings changed for the different cities. Working through a digital tool to collect data brought up interesting questions about perception. The colors I was able to collect through a color picker were always skewed based on shadow. Even the process of generating jpgs changed the coloring. Each step of my documentation moved further from reality and the picture of the city I was presenting became less authentic.</div>
